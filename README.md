# Crayola
This application was built using React and it allows users to create their own colour palettes using new colours or by generating random colours which are stored in the local storage. The users can copy colours from other palettes using RGB, RGBA and HEX colour codes. The users can also delete the colour palettes and sort the colours by dragging them.
